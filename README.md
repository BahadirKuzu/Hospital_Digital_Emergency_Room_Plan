# Hospital Digital Emergency Room (DER) Plan

## Project Overview
This repository contains a detailed plan for the digitalization of hospital emergency rooms (DER). The goal is to improve operational efficiency, enhance patient care, and streamline hospital management through real-time monitoring, predictive simulations, and automated management systems.

## Key Objectives
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Implementation of a system that tracks hospital infrastructure, patients, staff, and external resources.
- **Predictive Simulations**: Use of data from sensors and AI to simulate and predict potential issues or crises.
- **Automated Management**: Automation of daily hospital operations to minimize human intervention, optimize energy use, and prevent breakdowns.

## Features
- **Sensor System**: Distributed sensors to gather real-time data from the hospital environment.
- **AI Integration**: Use of artificial intelligence for predictive maintenance and crisis simulations.
- **BIM Integration**: Utilize data from Building Information Modeling (BIM) for static and dynamic data recovery.
- **Remote Access**: Real-time updates and remote monitoring capabilities for hospital management and staff.

## Stakeholders
- City and University Hospitals
- Regional Emergency Services
- National Health Service (SSN)
- Private Health Facilities
- Public Health Providers

## Benefits
- Enhanced crisis prevention through predictive maintenance and simulations.
- Reduced operational costs and manpower requirements.
- Improved resource synchronization across the healthcare network.
- Better energy management and reduced environmental impact.
